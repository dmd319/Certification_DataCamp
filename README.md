# Certification_DataCamp
This is my project for the certification presentation, the workspace is a bit tricky to pull into Git but the HTML's should work.

The "notebook" file is just my script, whereas "GRADE-Presentation" is what I actually presented. 

This includes some data cleaning with real Google Business Review data, a K-Means model, and analysis of that K-Means, and how it would all apply in a business setting for a marketing team. The prompt given is below:

# DataCamp Certification Case Study

### Project Brief

You are on the data science team for a coffee company that is looking to expand their business into Ukraine. They want to get an understanding of the existing coffee shop market there.

You have a dataset from Google businesses. It contains information about coffee shops in Ukraine. The marketing manager wants to identify the key coffee shop segments. They will use this to construct their marketing plan. In their current location, they split the market into 5 segments. The marketing manager wants to know how many segments are in this new market, and their key features.

You will be presenting your findings to the Marketing Manager, who has no data science background.

The data you will use for this analysis can be accessed here: `"data/coffee_shops.csv"`
